## Tech stack & Open-source libraries

 - Minimum SDK level 21
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- Jetpack
  - Lifecycle: Observe Android lifecycles and handle UI states upon the lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data holder and lifecycle aware. Allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
  - DataBinding: Binds UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
  - Room: Constructs Database by providing an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) - 
  - [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
  - [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - DI for injecting `ViewModel`.
  [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) - Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs.
- [Coil](https://github.com/coil-kt/coil) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
- [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/) - Realm is a mobile-first database designed for modern, data-driven applications. You can use Realm to build mobile, web, desktop, and IoT apps.


## Modularization

<img src="/preview/modular.ppg" align="center" width="3840"/>

**NoteApp** adopted modularization strategies below:

- **Reusability**: Modulizing reusable codes properly enable opportunities for code sharing and limits code accessibility in other modules at the same time.
- **Parallel Building**: Each module can be run in parallel and it reduces the build time.
- **Strict visibility control**: Modules restrict to expose dedicated components and access to other layers, so it prevents they're being used outside the module
- **Decentralized focusing**: Each developer team can assign their dedicated module and they can focus on their own modules.
